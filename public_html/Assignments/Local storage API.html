        <div><b>Local Storage</b> can be used to store certain details about a user
            as well as cut down request for database information.<br>
        It is has a longer term memory that remains persistence unlike the session storage which clears when the 
        user exit the browser</div>
        <p>The <b>"localStorage.clear()"</b> command is used to delete nor clear information 
        from a local storage sense.</p>
